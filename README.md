Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/weatherpoller

This program is designed to interface with the FineOffset line of weather stations (WH1080, WH1081, W-8681, etc). These are also sold under other brands, such as Proove WP1400, the model I have.

The information about how the data is stored on the device is based on information from Jim Easterbrooks webpage, including the EasyWeather.dat layout.

It was developed as a commandline alternative to the Windows program EasyWeather.

To write this program, the USB Protocol used was sniffed using SnoopyPro.

Note: I don't use this program actively myself anymore, since I found this more complete project which does a lot more things across the board http://jim-easterbrook.github.io/pywws/doc/en/html/index.html and is highly recommended. (Not if you want a minimalistic C version of course).
